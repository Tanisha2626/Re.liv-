We first covered the basics of UI/UX design using Figma.
Next we covered basic tutorials on HTML and CSS.
After than we completed a wide course on Javascript basics and React Library to design the frontend.
Next we designed our UI for the site which we would be building. 
From the second checkpoint onwards we will start working on the frontened of the website followed by the backend.
